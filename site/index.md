# G'day ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt

I'm a software developer from Australia with a passion for solving complex problems and exploring new technologies. 

I hold a degree in computer science and am currently working as a web developer, where I primarily use WordPress and PHP. Beyond my job, I'm also proficient in C++, JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.

This site is made with **Lume** which is a flexible framework that allows me to make easy updates and expansions in the future.

## Projects

* **NESBuddy**

  This is a NES emulator I'm currently working on to improve my skills in emulator development. It is written in C++ and uses SDL2 for multimedia. It is still a work-in-progress where I am slowly implementing graphics rendering.
  
* **CHIP-8 Emulator**

  Interest in game console emulators led me to initially create a CHIP-8 emulator. This was my first experience with C and low-level programming. The project is built with Xmake and utilises SDL2 and miniaudio for graphics and audio capabilities. I'm planning to rewrite this project in Zig.

* **Sudoku**
 
  This is a web-based project which I created to practice React and TypeScript. I created a simple sudoku frontend featuring multiple difficulties and a timer. Components were made using Mantine. Zustand was used for game state management.
